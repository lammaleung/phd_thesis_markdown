<!-- This is the abstract -->

Mystery shopping is a useful method commonly adopted by companies and organizations to improve their business strategies. It helps to analyze their companies from a customer perspective, which provides ideas that the companies may not discover. However, mystery shopping is manpower consuming and cost-ineffective. To solve this problem, my project is to build a mystery shopper application "WeTell", which applies homonym of "Retail" to demonstrate that it provides mystery shopping service to retail industry and tells the industry opinions in customer perspectives. The details of WeTell will be described in the following paragraphs.
