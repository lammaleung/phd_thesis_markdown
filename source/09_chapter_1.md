# Introduction

## Background

Mystery shopping is widely used as a diagnostic tool for service quality evaluations throughout the year. It applies an anonymous observation from a customer perspective, which includes product quality, service delivery procedures, and front-line staff performance. It can be used in all industries, from business-to-consumer(B2C) and business-to-business(B2B), but mostly it is used by B2C industries, such as retail, hotels, restaurants, and transportation. Enterprises can organize mystery shopping programs by themselves or purchase the service from mystery shopping providers. 

## Current situation
To complete a mystery shopping program, it involves three types of characters, which are mystery shopper company, mystery shopper, and enterprise. Mystery shopper companies employ and train mystery shoppers to provide mystery shopper service when enterprises purchase mystery shopping services. 

The current workflow for organizing a mystery shopping program involves:
 - Recruitment and training
Mystery shopper company first recruits mystery shoppers. When mystery shopper service is purchased, the company will organize the training sessions for shoppers if the shoppers have not experienced any related job yet.
 - Discussion with enterprise
The agent of the mystery shopper company will discuss details of the service with the enterprise, including price, evaluation questions, and requirements. The price of the service will be introduced in packages. For example, the enterprise may purchase a one-year-package, which includes two visits per month. 
 - Arrangements of manpower
Once the agent receives a job from a client, he/she will draft details of the task, including date, requirements, and salary. Then he/she will send the task information to shoppers, who satisfy the client's requirement and make an arrangement through email or messages. 
 - Evaluation
Mystery shopper observes the environment and staff behaviour during an evaluation. Audio and photos will be recorded if it is required. Shoppers will fill in an evaluation form in excel and send it to the mystery shopper company. 
 - Data processing and analysis
 After receiving an evaluation from shoppers, clerical staff will be assigned to take charge of the data including revising audio scripts, verifying the data, and preparing a report for the client. The report may include shoppers' experience, related monthly statistics, and ad-hoc enhancement suggestions. 
 - Reporting to enterprise
When the report is ready, the clerical staff will send it to the client. The staff will explain the report details to the client in person if it is the first report. In the case of inquiry from the client, the staff would answer by phone or in person. 

The process of a mystery shopping program is considered as time, money, manpower consuming, and cost-ineffective. The agent has to search for targeted shoppers, which fit the task requirements and draft task information and details manually. Moreover, to process and analyze the data, the clerical staff members have to verify the data and generate the statistics by hand. The manual process increases the workload of the staff when it is not effective, especially in reviewing the data and analyzing the statistics. 

On the other hand, the current evaluation form in excel is not user friendly and inconvenient for shoppers. Shoppers are required to match questions and answers in excel, which increases the chance of making of mistakes. Also, the data are sent to the staff by email. With a large number of emails, there is a possibility to miss the data. The manual process raises the inaccuracy of the data.

Due to the significant costs of a mystery shopping program, the price of the service is not affordable by the small and medium-sized enterprises. Also, enterprises expect to have a short-term or one-time mystery shopping program instead of having it in a package.

WeTell is an alternative way to provide cost-effective services for enterprises. It is a peer-to-peer platform between enterprises and mystery shoppers. Mystery shoppers are allowed to accept tasks when enterprises post the tasks on the app. When shoppers finish a task, the statistics and reports will be generated automatically. Not only does the app reduce the costs of the mystery shopping program, but it also increases the accuracy of the data. 

## Existing system
MissionPick is an existing mystery shopper application in Hong Kong, which allows users to earn money by finishing mystery shopping tasks. To initiate a task, enterprises can fill in the form on the mystery shopper company's website or send an email to the company. The staff will contact them and discuss the details of mystery shopping programs with them. They will get real-time results for the task. 

Users are allowed to register as a mystery shopper. To complete the registration, it requires approval from the admin team, which takes 2 to 3 days. Before shoppers start their first task, they have to finish training tasks, and this simulates the process of a mystery shopping task. Once they submit a task, the task will be reviewed by the quality control team. Shoppers will receive payment in 7 days if the evaluation is accepted. Photos and insights of the result will be updated and sent to the enterprises. 

MissionPick provides a convenient platform for mystery shoppers. However, it contains a lot of manual operations, such as approval of user registration, reviewing the quality of evaluations, and creating tasks. It is manpower consuming and cost-ineffective. Moreover, enterprises have to discuss with the mystery shopper company in-person to create a task. Both enterprises and mystery shopper companies have to spend a largen amount of time to schedule and arrange the task. 

Moreover, MissionPick only allows users to search for tasks by location, which is not user-friendly. It is expected to provide filters for users to choose their targeted jobs. Also, to get the detail information of the task, users have to click on the task on the map. It is expected to preview the task before the user input. 

## Objectives
The purpose of this project is to develop a mystery shopper application that provides a peer-to-peer platform for enterprises and inspectors on mystery shopping services. The main objectives of the project are:
 1. to reduce the manual operations
WeTell is designed to automate the manual operations of mystery shopping programs. The system authenticates the data through algorithms so that the process of registration, task verification, and data analysis can be smoothed and unobstructed. For example, the system will track user location to ensure shoppers are in the shop area. 
 2. to provide a user-friendly interface
The Inspector platform of WeTell shows important information about the tasks as a list, such as a shop type, pay, shop's name, and address. Inspectors are allowed to filter tasks by shop type and pay. They can also reserve or start the task instantly.
 3. to enhance the accuracy of the data
When shoppers submit their evaluations, the system will process the data. Enterprises will receive the evaluation results instantly. When the task is completed, the system will generate a report with statistics and insights into the enterprises.
