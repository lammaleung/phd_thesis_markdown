# System Implementation

## System Architecture
WeTell is formed by three components, which are application for users to access the system, server for handling requests and database for storing data records.

### Mobile application
Flutter is an open-source and cross-platform mobile SDK created by Google. It can be used to build both iOS and Android apps from the same code base. [@flutterdev] Flutter apps are built using dart, which is an object-oriented programming language, therefore it is dynamic and extensible. Also, Flutter eliminates JavaScript bridge and is complied to native machine code, so that the performance Flutter apps . mdeIt can be used to build both iOS and Android apps from the same code base. [@flutterdev] Flutter apps are built using dart, which is an object-oriented programming language, therefore it is dynamic and extensible. 

### Server
Sails.js is the most trendy MVC framework for Node.js, which helps build custom and enterprise-grade apps. It is built on Node.js, uses Express for handling HTTP requests. [@sailsjs] Sails bundles a powerful Object-Relational-Mapper(ORM), waterline, which provides a simple data access layer to any database. [@sailsjs]

### Database
MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility, which is a non-relational database engine. MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. [@mongodb]

## Features

### Login/ Sign up

![Authentication page (enterprise) \label{feature(E)-login_signup}](source/figures/feature(E)-login_signup.png){ width=100% }

When WeTell is started, a welcome page is shown. Users are allowed to select their roles, either an enterprise or an inspector. When a user clicks "Enterprise" button, WeTell navigates to the login page of enterprise portal. The user can input his/her registered email and password for login. If the user has not created an account yet, he/she can tap "Sign up for new account" to move to "Enterprise Signup" page. To create a new account, the email input must not be taken. Also, the password input must have more than 5 digits. When the account is created, a notification with welcoming message sends to the enterprise, when the "Thank you for signing up" page is shown. The user interface of login and signup pages in inspector portal are similar.

### View Profile 

![My profile page (enterprise) \label{feature(E)-my_profile}](source/figures/feature(E)-my_profile.png){ width=100% }

By tapping the last tab of bottom bar, a profile page is presented, which demonstrates the user information. For enterprise portal, the name, email, industry, and balance are shown. The enteprise can tap "Edit Profile" button to edit his/her information. When the submit button is tapped, the profile page with updated information is navigated.

### Notification

![Notification page (enterprise) \label{feature(E)-notification}](source/figures/feature(E)-notification.png){ width=100% }

If an enterprise or an inspector login successfully, a notificaiton page is shown, which is the homepage of both portals. User can also tap the first tab of bottom bar to enter this page. The user interfaces of two portals are similar. When the user clicks a notification on the notification list, the details of the notification is introduced. 

### Search and Reserve Task (Inspector)

![Search task page - sort by price (inspector) \label{feature(I)-search_task_sorting}](source/figures/feature(I)-search_task_sorting.png){ width=100% }

When inspectors tap on the "Search Task" tab, a list of filtered tasks is shown. If the inspector has reserved 6 or more tasks, no search results are shown. WeTell will show a message that the number of reserved tasks reached the quota, and remind the inspector to complete tasks. Also, the system matches the type of inspector and tasks' requirements. When enterprises create tasks, they can select a type of inspector. Therefore, if the inspectors do not satisfy the requirement, the task will not be sent from the server. When inspectors click the "Sort by Price" button, the list of tasks is sorted from high price to low price. In contrast, when inspectors click the "Sort by Distance" button, the list of tasks is sorted from low distance to high distance.

![Search task page - map marker (inspector) \label{feature(I)-search_task_marker}](source/figures/feature(I)-search_task_marker.png){ width=100% }

Moreover, WeTell applies Google Maps plugins to present the locations of tasks, which are located by the red markers. When an inspector clicks a marker, an information window with the task's title and address is shown over the marker. The camera position will then focus on the task's location. If the user clicks the information window, the detail of the task is shown.

![Search task page - details page (inspector) \label{feature(I)-search_task_detail}](source/figures/feature(I)-search_task_detail.png){ width=100% }

![Search task page - reservation (inspector) \label{feature(I)-search_task_reserve}](source/figures/feature(I)-search_task_reserve.png){ width=100% }
When an inspector clicks the "Reserve the task" button, a pop-up window is shown. If the inspector clicks the "Regret" button, WeTell navigates back to the "Task Detail" page. If the inspector clicks the "Confirm" button, the server will update the user record and task record. A completion of reservation message will be shown on the page.

![Search task page - reservation (inspector) \label{feature(I)-search_task_done}](source/figures/feature(I)-search_task_done.png){ width=100% }
Tapping the "Return to Search Page" button, WeTell routes to the "Search Page".

### Complete Task (Inspector)

Then they can click "Confirm" button in the pop up window. As a result, the task will be removed in the list of reserved tasks. WeTell returns to view list of reserved tasks. On the other hand, inspectors are allowed to start the evaluation on a task by tapping "Start Task" button.

For all tasks, inspectors are asked to confirm the shop name and the address in order to avoid mistakes. If the answer is "No", WeTell returns a message showing that the task is invalid, then inspectors can click "Return" button to go back to "My Tasks" page. At the same time, a notification is sent to the corresponding enterprise to ask for the verification of the address and shop name. If the answer is "Yes", WeTell navigates to next question. 

![Task question page (inspector) \label{feature(I)-start_task_opinion}](source/figures/feature(I)-start_task_opinion.png){ width=100% }

When all evaluation questions are answered, inspectors are asked to fill the text field if they have any extra information related to the task. If they do not have any, the field should be empty. Clicking "Next" button, a review of answers is shown. Inspectors can edit their answers in the page. To submit the evaluation, inspectors tap "Submit" button.
