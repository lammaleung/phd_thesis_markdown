## Difficulties and Limitations

Since Flutter is a new technologies compared to other mobile application frameworks, which is released in May 2017 and the current version is 1.12.13 [1]. Therefore, it lack of third-party libraries and packages. For example, for In-App payments in Flutter, it requires third-party libraries. However, the resources are mostly not well-documented, therefore it is difficult to implement the libraries. Comparing to Flutter, it is easy to search modules for React Native framework on Google. Flutter's official resource of free packages is getting better, however its list of tools is still improving.
